Our Growth Culture

One of the reasons our company continues to thrive after 130+ years is having a company culture that supports and rewards behaviors that lead to growth. Our “Growth Behaviors,” as we call them, are ways of being and working that help to make us successful. Think about how you can bring this to life in your next role at Coca-Cola.

Curious
Keep seeking, never settle. Staying curious about what is outside, and two steps ahead inspires us to challenge the status quo. Having the courage to look and leap is the way we grow. Because asking “what if?” pushes us to the next level as people and as a company.

Empowered
Make it happen. True empowerment is the result of taking responsibility. This means giving yourself permission to see it, say it and do it, and owning the outcomes. Because we move forward faster when we all take action.

Version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
Push for progress, not perfection. There are very few overnight successes. Greatness is borne of many little victories (and failures). Share v 1.0, test it, and make it better. Then create the next version. Because the moment we think something is perfect, it will be obsolete.

Inclusive
Include, value and trust each other. We are smart alone but together we are genius. This means being inclusive, giving the benefit of the doubt and being responsible for each other. Because, for our company to thrive for the next 100+ years, smart isn’t enough. We need genius.

Job Description

 
Risk analytics spans a broad set of empirically-based disciplines (applied statistics, econometrics, applied mathematics, algorithmics / optimization, and machine learning / data science) applied to and across all the major risk silos (credit, market, operational, liquidity, and model risk, with a focus on liquidity risk).  We are seeking experts in these fields to apply their training and experience to optimize risk-and-return business decisions in the Performance and Analytics team within Allstate’s Enterprise Risk and Return Management group.  We place a premium on expert statistical and econometric programming skills/experience with real-world data (e.g. SAS, Matlab, Python, SPSS, R, C++).  A deep understanding of the value/necessity of independent replication and model validation is key, as is the knowledge of multiplicity/FDR issues and the ability and expertise to avoid overfitting.  We highly value a very strong curiosity factor in exploring / understanding datasets containing covariates with complex relationships, appropriately tempered by the need for provable rigor and scientifically defensible and replicable methods based on modular, transparent, and well-documented code.  This is consistent with the value we place on non-siloed, cross-disciplinary solutions to complex, real-world, non-textbook business challenges.  The Risk Analytics Data Scientist is responsible for aligning with and contributing to corporate objectives by identifying and developing growth and profitability opportunities that will enable Allstate to generate profitable market share growth.  He/she is accountable for using data and non-trivial statistical/econometric code that in most circumstances, seamlessly and directly translates into material business decisions for the firm.  This includes building predictive models and developing original-yet-defensible methods that enable Allstate to make better decisions and win in the marketplace.

This role is responsible for leading the use of data to make risk-and-return analytics decisions, with a focus on liquidity risk. This includes, more broadly, the development and management of predictive modeling and the design and development and vetting of original methodology; statistical/econometric empirically-based coding expertise in at least one major relevant language is required (e.g. SAS, Matlab, Python, SPSS, R, C++) as this will serve as the basis by which the abovementioned business decisions are made.  More specifically, this role will leverage the candidate’s experience with various approaches – both established and derived, original methods – to estimating and managing liquidity risk to effectively and efficiently drive capital decisions.  This role will manage complex projects and require some mentoring as it will have direct reports.

 
Key Responsibilities

 

Uses best practices to implement and develop complex statistical, econometric, and machine learning techniques to build risk analytics models that directly address material business needs.

Incorporates independent replication and model validation methods into the model development process and understands the necessity for this, as well as the extreme efficiency gains that result from this best practice.

The ability to boil down, without dumbing down, is critical: communicates effectively to team members, leadership and stakeholders on findings to ensure models are well understood and incorporated into business processes.  Provides stakeholders the opportunity to influence the direction of the work via feedback loops.

Knowledge of, and experience dealing with multiplicity/FDR issues, and the ability and expertise to avoid overfitting, is key.

Develop and execute non-siloed, cross-disciplinary solutions to complex, non-textbook business challenges.

Works on data and complex business problems to drive improved risk-and-return business decisions and results by designing, building, and partnering to implement the right models for the right problems (e.g. Hadoop is not necessary (or desirable) for mere gigabytes of data, and random forests is not necessary (or desirable) when OLS conditions are sufficiently met).

Can identify new areas of data, research and methodology/models that can solve relevant risk-and-return business challenges.

Collaborates the with team to understand the business’ problems to identify the optimal methodological, and modeling (method+language/platform), approaches.

Mentors and develops junior data scientists.


 
Job Qualifications

 

Master’s or PhD degree or concentration in a quantitative field such as statistics, econometrics/economics, data science, applied mathematics, computer science, and/or finance.

Peer reviewed publications & related awards are highly valued / desired, as are technical conference decks.

Academic honors, top standardized test scores, scholarships and fellowships are highly valued / desired.

Serving as referee / reviewer / editor of academic and industry journals is highly valued / desired.

Best-of-breed expertise in working with statistical software such as SAS, MatLab, Python, SPSS, R, C++.

Demonstrated expertise using statistical and econometric modeling and/or machine learning techniques to build models of nontrivial size and complexity that have driven company decision making.

Experience with various approaches – both established and derived, original methods – to estimating and managing liquidity risk to effectively and efficiently drive capital decisions.

Demonstrated experience incorporating independent replication and model validation methods into the model development process.

Junior Data Scientist,"The Hired Guns are seeking an ambitious entry-level data scientist for a major publisher of digital news, sports, entertainment and lifestyle content to scale the project at pace with its exploding scope. Bring your Python/R skills to NYC and leapfrog your previous career track.

Nitty Gritty

This mega-print house has a lean team and a large empire, so it can’t grow fast enough, but it sure can grow wisely. A data analyst who can build models and automated tools will help hit their targets in churning, retention, and propensity models, while springboarding their own career.

Can you say DBT? Using your business analytics savvy, you and the data engineers will put together your fluent knowledge of Python and R to run some A/B and iterative tests, analyze training data, summarize marketing’s findings, and properly segment/enact the audience findings for AI/machine learning digestion. Causation and forecasting are a particular focus here, so get ready to discuss your thesis on subscriber propensity.

You’ll work straight with stakeholders, set your own course (though not your own speed), and make key decisions about where to devote your very in-demand time. Learn quickly, and the sooner your grateful boss will be free to do his job, which, in turn, will bestow new responsibilities on you in this fast-track opportunity to put serious miles on your career in a very short time.

What Success Looks Like

In three months you’ll know the systems as if you wrote them yourself. If you have the same duties a year from now, you’ve already failed. Instead, you’ll be calling enough shots to make a notable impact on the shape of the ever-growing project. You’re a data-mountaineer of an environment that will never be so developmental at this scale again in history, and you’re itching to chart its terrain with lots of feedback requested, but very little support required.

Hired Gun Profile

These gurus want to teach someone hungry, eager to learn, and worth their time to teach. Still in your entry-level stage yet already a subject-matter expert, you’re a proud nerd looking for a mentor rather than a babysitter. Your boss is a self-confessed shy guy who’s happy to coach you whether you’re the same or extroverted: “I do a good job empowering people and advancing their careers.”

You want to ditch the “entry-level” appellation before you’re out of the first few years of your career, and even if rapid promotion weren’t the only option for success, you’d dig the duties of this job because you’re a problem-solver whose thrill is navigating multi-stage challenges.

Your background is hands-on math with a blend of data engineering, data science, and maybe something outside the box. It’s given you vision about where your field is going and you’re unafraid to huck big ideas at the bosses. You may even want to cite a sandbox study that backs you up, because they’re going to ask you about a time you applied Python or R to a real-life business case.

Oh, and come ready to write an algorithm for a problem they’re trying to tackle. Nobody expects you to solve it, but if you do, that’s pretty much you hired.

Inside Skinny

An interest in the media landscape itself is the secret sauce to jumping in with both feet.

Net-Net

Want to be a senior director within five years of starting your career? Two years from now you’ll be a lot more than two years further along in your career. That’s a rare opportunity even if it weren’t with a publisher so mammoth it has its own gravity.

Do you enjoy influencing business decisions by providing fact-based recommendations infused with intuition?

Pocket protectors not required.

THE ROLE: Mgr/Sr. Mgr., Portfolio Analytics

Track A+E’s share of the audience, position in the marketplace vs competitive set (e.g., number of top 10 shows in all of cable, in all of television, etc.)

Navigate multiple data sources, including Nielsen, Inscape, set-top-box data, etc.

What You’ll Learn

As the media industry grapples with fragmentation and disruption, a key facet of Research is to be the driving force in helping their company capture, report on, monetize, and understand audiences. An opportunity lies in Research to work across divisions and departments to create a unified language that ensures that internal clients understand—and take advantage of—complex metrics. The key is giving the necessary context so that decisions can be made. While this sounds disarmingly simple, it is a challenge to get the majority of the company to speak the same language and understand new vernacular. Research is a central force within the broader organization in gaining an objective perspective for a wide array of complex questions. It may sound academic – and certainly there is a portion of the job that requires a love of learning – but the primary attribute that will bring you success is curiosity. For example, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of what motivates someone to tune into a show, buy a product based on placement of an ad, become a fan on social media, or why certain types of programs are successful across regions of this country and abroad. Ultimately, each research candidate gets a better understanding of the rigor that goes into making business decisions by uncovering not boulders, but pebbles along the path to connecting to A+E Networks core asset, its content.

YOUR STORY [+BEHAVIORS] (what you need to have)
Expertise
Sophisticated use of audience data (e.g., Nielsen, comScore, Adobe Analytics, MRI), business data (Kagan, Moffett-Nathanson, SEC reports), primary research
Experience with smart TV/set-top-box data sources
Proficient analysis of content across linear, digital and SVOD/AVOD platforms
Competencies
Strategic thinker with strong presentation skills
Strong leadership and team-building capabilities
Excellent written and verbal skills
Curious and self-motivated work style
Strong work ethic and detail-oriented
Collaborative
Passionate about the business
Education and experience
College BA/BS degree (master’s degree preferred)
3-5 years of progressive experience in programming/revenue research with significant business acumen (preferably 2+ years in cable/syndication)
THAT SOMETHING EXTRA: If you’ve read this far, you’re likely a great fit for us…and maybe you’re fluent in sign language, have studied the circus arts or are currently writing a screenplay. If you have a special skill or backstory that might directly or indirectly help you succeed in this role, we’d love to hear about it in your cover letter. * * * * * A+E Networks is proud to uphold an equal opportunity employment policy and employs personnel without regard to race, creed, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, age, physical or mental ability, veteran status, military obligations, and marital status.

Our Growth Culture

One of the reasons our company continues to thrive after 130+ years is having a company culture that supports and rewards behaviors that lead to growth. Our “Growth Behaviors,” as we call them, are ways of being and working that help to make us successful. Think about how you can bring this to life in your next role at Coca-Cola.

Curious
Keep seeking, never settle. Staying curious about what is outside, and two steps ahead inspires us to challenge the status quo. Having the courage to look and leap is the way we grow. Because asking “what if?” pushes us to the next level as people and as a company.

Empowered
Make it happen. True empowerment is the result of taking responsibility. This means giving yourself permission to see it, say it and do it, and owning the outcomes. Because we move forward faster when we all take action.

Version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
Push for progress, not perfection. There are very few overnight successes. Greatness is borne of many little victories (and failures). Share v 1.0, test it, and make it better. Then create the next version. Because the moment we think something is perfect, it will be obsolete.

Inclusive
Include, value and trust each other. We are smart alone but together we are genius. This means being inclusive, giving the benefit of the doubt and being responsible for each other. Because, for our company to thrive for the next 100+ years, smart isn’t enough. We need genius.

We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and do not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, sex, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, status as a veteran, and basis of disability or any other federal, state or local protected class.

As a Backend Software Engineer, you’ll build the system that runs our elastic big data analytics platform written in Scala that runs in the AWS cloud. Our system is a highly distributed, fault tolerant, multi-tenant platform that includes bleeding edge components related to storage, messaging, search, and analytics. This system ingests and analyzes terabytes of data a day, while making petabytes of data available for search and forensic analysis, and is expected to reach substantially larger scale in the near future.

You are a strong software engineer who is passionate about large-scale systems. You care about producing clean, elegant, maintainable, robust, well-tested code; you do this as a member of a team, helping the group come up with a better solution than you would as individuals. Ideally, you have experience with performance, scalability, and reliability issues of 24x7 commercial services.

What You Will Be Doing
Designing and implementing extremely high-volume, fault-tolerant, scalable backend systems that process and manage petabytes of customer data.
Analyze and improve the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of our backend systems.
Write robust code; demonstrate its robustness through automated tests.
Work as a member of a team, helping the team respond quickly and effectively to business needs.
Help manage exabytes of data using the latest and greatest technologies such as Kafka, Kubernetes and Docker!


Requirements
B.S. in Computer Sciences or related discipline (M.S., or Ph.D. is a plus)
Minimum 3+ years of industry experience with a proven track record of ownership and delivery
Experience in multi-threaded programming and distributed systems.
Object-oriented programming experience, for example in Java, Scala, Ruby, or C++.
Understand performance characteristics of commonly used data structures (maps, lists, trees, etc).
Desire to learn Scala, an up-and-coming JVM language (scala-lang.org).


Desirable
Experience in big data and/or 24x7 commercial service is highly desirable.
You should be happy working with Unix (Linux, OS X).
Agile software development experience (test-driven development, iterative and incremental development) is a plus.

Our Growth Culture

One of the reasons our company continues to thrive after 130+ years is having a company culture that supports and rewards behaviors that lead to growth. Our “Growth Behaviors,” as we call them, are ways of being and working that help to make us successful. Think about how you can bring this to life in your next role at Coca-Cola.

Curious

Keep seeking, never settle. Staying curious about what is outside, and two steps ahead inspires us to challenge the status quo. Having the courage to look and leap is the way we grow. Because asking “what if?” pushes us to the next level as people and as a company.

Empowered

Make it happen . True empowerment is the result of taking responsibility. This means giving yourself permission to see it, say it and do it, and owning the outcomes. Because we move forward faster when we all take action.

Version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0

Push for progress, not perfection. There are very few overnight successes. Greatness is borne of many little victories (and failures). Share v 1.0, test it, and make it better. Then create the next version. Because the moment we think something is perfect, it will be obsolete.

Inclusive

Include, value and trust each other. We are smart alone but together we are genius. This means being inclusive, giving the benefit of the doubt and being responsible for each other. Because, for our company to thrive for the next 100+ years, smart isn't enough. We need genius.

We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and do not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, sex, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, status as a veteran, and basis of disability or any other federal, state or local protected class.

Our Growth Culture

One of the reasons our company continues to thrive after 130+ years is having a company culture that supports and rewards behaviors that lead to growth. Our “Growth Behaviors,” as we call them, are ways of being and working that help to make us successful. Think about how you can bring this to life in your next role at Coca-Cola.

Curious
Keep seeking, never settle. Staying curious about what is outside, and two steps ahead inspires us to challenge the status quo. Having the courage to look and leap is the way we grow. Because asking “what if?” pushes us to the next level as people and as a company.

Empowered
Make it happen. True empowerment is the result of taking responsibility. This means giving yourself permission to see it, say it and do it, and owning the outcomes. Because we move forward faster when we all take action.

Version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
Push for progress, not perfection. There are very few overnight successes. Greatness is borne of many little victories (and failures). Share v 1.0, test it, and make it better. Then create the next version. Because the moment we think something is perfect, it will be obsolete.

Inclusive
Include, value and trust each other. We are smart alone but together we are genius. This means being inclusive, giving the benefit of the doubt and being responsible for each other. Because, for our company to thrive for the next 100+ years, smart isn’t enough. We need genius.

This role requires partnering closely with a team of data scientists, business analysts & data engineers leading the cloud-based Big Data & Analytics strategy . The successful candidate will implement complex AWS-based big data projects with a focus on collecting, parsing, managing, analyzing, querying, and visualizing large sets of data to turn information into insights using multiple technology platforms.

T his role also requires an understanding of how a secure big data cloud environment is architected to gain real insights faster, with less friction and complexity.

Key Functions

The successful candidate will perform the following tasks:
Lead the design, implementation, and continuous delivery of pipelines using distributed AWS-based big data technologies supporting data processing initiatives across batch and streaming datasets
Development and design using Python language and Big Data Frameworks such as Spark, AWS Athena, Presto, APIs, etc.

Providing architectural support by building Proof of Concepts & Prototypes

What You’ll Learn

As the media industry grapples with fragmentation and disruption, a key facet of Research is to be the driving force in helping their company capture, report on, monetize, and understand audiences. An opportunity lies in Research to work across divisions and departments to create a unified language that ensures that internal clients understand—and take advantage of—complex metrics. The key is giving the necessary context so that decisions can be made. While this sounds disarmingly simple, it is a challenge to get the majority of the company to speak the same language and understand new vernacular. Research is a central force within the broader organization in gaining an objective perspective for a wide array of complex questions. It may sound academic – and certainly there is a portion of the job that requires a love of learning – but the primary attribute that will bring you success is curiosity. For example, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of what motivates someone to tune into a show, buy a product based on placement of an ad, become a fan on social media, or why certain types of programs are successful across regions of this country and abroad. Ultimately, each research candidate gets a better understanding of the rigor that goes into making business decisions by uncovering not boulders, but pebbles along the path to connecting to A+E Networks core asset, its content.
